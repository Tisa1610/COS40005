      When an event reaches severity level 3 or higher this playbook will
      attempt to contain the threat by killing the offending process (if
      present) and isolating the host from the network.  It will also
      notify via the builtâ€‘in notification callback.
    triggers:
      min_severity: 3
    actions:
      - type: kill_process
      - type: isolate_network
      - type: notify

  - name: "suspicious_process_start"

      Respond specifically to the launch of known scripting or LOLBIN
      processes (powershell, wscript, cscript, mshta) regardless of the
      severity assigned by the dispatcher.  The process will be terminated
      immediately and the host isolated.
    triggers:
      type: process
      min_severity: 2
    actions:
      - type: kill_process
      - type: isolate_network
      - type: notify
