# AI Module Placeholder

This directory is reserved for the future AI and predictive analytics
components of the OT ransomware platform.  Other team members will
populate this folder with modules for hybrid detection (behavioural,
signature, heuristic), dynamic sandbox analysis, continuous model
retraining and federated learning.  No code lives here yet but the
structure is provided so that it can be easily integrated alongside the
realâ€‘time monitoring and automated response system.
