# Backup and Recovery Placeholder

This directory is reserved for the secure backup, recovery and vaulting
components of the platform.  A separate team will implement immutable
snapshot storage, automated recovery workflows and regular verification
of backup integrity.  Keeping these components modular ensures that
critical data remains protected even when the live systems are under
attack.
